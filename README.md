# Bag o' Loot API

Based on the Bag o' Loot command line application that you have worked on during orientation, this API will expose two resources for client developers to consume for other application they want to write.

1. The **Child** resource at the URI of `http://localhost:5000/api/child`
2. The **Toy** resource at the URI of `http://localhost:5000/api/toy`

You can use this as a baseline resource when building your own Web API.
